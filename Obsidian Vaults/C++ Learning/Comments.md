2. how the code accomplished the goal inside 
3. at statement level, describing why the code is doing something

in other words:
1.  At the library, program, or function level, use comments to describe what.
2.  Inside the library, program, or function, use comments to describe how.
3.  At the statement level, use comments to describe why.
