# Variables and Data types
value: a single piece of data
object -> represents a region of storage (typically RAM or CPU register) that can hold a value
* objects in c++ can be anonymous (be unnamed)
varibale: an object with a name
* in general programming the term object typically refers to an unnamed object in memory, a variable, or a function
* in C++, the term object has a narrower definition that excludes functions

definition statement: a special kind of declaration statement
runtime: when the program is loaded into memory and run
allocation: The process of reserving storage for an objectâ€™s use (at runtime each object is given an actual storage location (such as RAM, or a CPU register) that it can use to store values)
data type -> what kind of value the object will store
identifier: the name that a variable is accessed by.
