# Popular Packages, Libraries, Data Sets, and Phrases

==MNIST== Data Set: a large database of handwritten digits (in numpy array format, stored using pickle)
- ==Pickle== in Python is **primarily used in serializing and deserializing a Python object structure**

==PyTorch==: helps create and training neural networks ([source](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html))
modules and class:
- torch.nn
- torch.optim
- Dataset
- DataLoader
- ...

==Tensors==: In Pytorch here the word “tensor” is used as being synonymous with **multi-dimensional array**, and they are exactly the same as nd-arrays in numpy (a data structure)

==pathlib==: offers classes and methods to quickly perform the most common tasks involving file system paths. (will download the dataset using [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/))

==path objects== in pathlib:

==Cmap (Color maps)==: is a very useful tool for data visualization (in python colormaps)
