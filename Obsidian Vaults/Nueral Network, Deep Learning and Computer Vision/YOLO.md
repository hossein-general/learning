yolov3 improvements:
1. ***Backbone architecture***: Darknet-53
2. ***Multi-scale prediction***: predicts objects at three different scales using anchor boxes of different sizes
3. ***Smoother bounding box predictions***: uses a technique called bounding box regression, improve the accuracy of bounding box predictions
4. ***Faster training***: uses batch normalization and residual connections
