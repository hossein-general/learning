Python Naming Conventions:

General
	Avoid names that are too general or wordy. Maintain a good balance between the two.
	Bad: user_list, dict_to_store_defns_of_a_word, swapNums, moveInts.
	Good: user_info, word_definitions, swap_numbers, move_integers.
	Avoid naming things like “X”, “Y” or “Z”. Capitalize all letters of an abbreviation when using camelcase.
	Avoid names starting with digits. Combination of lowercase letters (a to z) or uppercase letters (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_) can be used.

Name a Package in python
	It is important to use only lowercase while naming a package in python.
	Use an underscore to join multiple words.
	However, it is preferable to keep a short name. (Stick into one-word name)

Module name
	Use lowercase for module names.
	Use an underscore to join multiple words to generate a meaningful module name.
	Stick to 1-word module names.

Class name in Python
	Class name in python should follow naming scheme called CapWords convention.
	Python has its built-in classes, however are typically lowercase.
	Exception classes should always end in “Error”.

Global Variables
	Global variables should be in lowercase
	Use an underscore to join words in a global variable.

Good Instance variable name
	Instance variable names should be in lowercase.
	Use an underscore to join multiple words in an instance variable.
	Non-public instance variable name should begin with a single underscore.
	Use two consecutive underscores at the beginning of an instance variable.

Method name in Python
	Use only lowercase in method names.
	An underscore should separate words in a method name.
	Non-public method name should begin with a single underscore.
	Use two consecutive underscores at the beginning of a method name, if it needs to be mangled.

Method Arguments
	Every instance method should have ‘self’ as its first argument.
	Class methods should have their first argument named ‘cls’.

Functions
	Function names should be in lower case.
	Use an underscore to join words in function name.

Constants in Python
	Only use upper case for constant names.
	Use an underscore as a separator to join multiple words to form a long constant name.
